Bernal et al (2017):
- ITS works best with short term outcomes that are expected to change either relatively quickly after an intervention is implemented or after a clearly defined lag.
- Given the requirement for a relatively long time series, routine data are often most appropriate in ITS studies.
Use of controls and other more complex ITS designs:
Where time-varying confounders are either unmeasured or unknown, a range of design adaptations can be used to control for possible concurrent events including: (1) adding a
control group or control outcome which would not have been affected by the intervention (known as a controlled interrupted time series); (2) using a multiple baseline design
whereby the intervention is introduced in different locations at different times; or (3) adding additional phases so that the intervention is first introduced and then withdrawn to
establish whether withdrawal of the intervention leads to a reversal of the effect.
